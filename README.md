# Linear Regression Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

## Overview
🏥 This project aims to predict medical insurance costs using linear regression. The dataset contains information such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The project involves data analysis, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and building a predictive system.

## Dependencies
- pandas 🐼
- numpy 🔢
- matplotlib 📊
- seaborn 🌊
- scikit-learn 🧬

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression-insurance-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd linear-regression-insurance-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to execute the project.

## Usage
1. **Data Collection and Analysis**: The dataset is loaded and basic exploration is performed including dimensions, information, missing values, and statistical measures.
2. **Data Pre-Processing**: Categorical features are encoded to numerical values and the dataset is split into features and target variable.
3. **Model Training**: Linear regression model is trained using the training data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using R-squared value on both training and testing datasets.
5. **Building a Predictive System**: Users can input their data for age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region, and the model will predict the insurance cost based on the provided input.
